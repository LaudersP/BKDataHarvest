# Enhanced BKDataHarvest

## Overview
Welcome to the Enhanced BKDataHarvest, an advanced fork of LLM Explorer's BKDataHarvest tool. This project extends the original functionality by scraping location and menu data from approximately 6,670 Burger King locations across the United States. The gathered data is used to create a heat map that visualizes the cost of living variations across different states.

## Features (Coming Soon...)
- **Data Collection:** Automatically scrapes and updates location and menu information from the Burger King website.
- **Visualization:** Generates a heat map to illustrate economic insights and the cost of living in various US states.
- **Interactive Tools:** Includes tools for users to explore data based on specific parameters and regions.
